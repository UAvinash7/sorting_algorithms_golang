/*

Bucket Sort or Bin Sort works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets.

Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.

It works as-

1. Setup an array of initially empty "buckets".
2. Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each element in its bucket.
3. Sort each non-empty bucket.
4. Gather: Visit the buckets, in order and put all elements back into the original array.
